## Areas Section
This section should contain all health areas, Physiotherapy, Dentistry, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics, etc...

## Categories Section
This section should be a sub section of the Areas Section, If you choose to search only for Physiotherapists, in the categories section, should list only the sub areas of the Physiotherapy field, etc...

## About
This app was made using the expo utility. Unfortunately I couldn't use an emulator or a real device, expo wasn't that happy this day so I recommend using the web version with the devtools activated, this way you can simulate the resolution of a mobile phone.
